# The Bitcoin Hole - Hardware Wallets

## Introduction

Hardware wallets are an essential tool for those who want to keep their bitcoin secure. These devices allow you to store your private keys offline, so they can’t be accessed by hackers or other online threats. But with so many hardware wallets on the market, it can be challenging to choose the right one for your needs.

This repository goal is to have the more complete database of Hardware Wallets features, so they can be compared, helping users to choose wisely. The database is open-source, meaning anyone can collaborate to improve and correct any wrong data or add new items.

## Collaboration

Inside the `items` directory, there is a JSON file for each wallet, with all the data about it. To collaborate (adding missing data, fixing wrong data or adding a new wallet), just fork the repository and send a pull request with the changes.

Before sending the pull request, please run the following commands to format the JSON:

```
cd scripts/
node json-format.js
```

## JSON format

The following is a sample of the JSON format:

```json
{
    "id": "wallet-id",
    "name": "Wallet Name",
    "purchasable": true,
    "category-name": {
      "feature-name-1": {
        "value": "YES", 
        "flag": "positive",
        "supported": true,
        "texts": [
          "Optional contextual text describing the feature"
        ],
        "links": [
          {
            "title": "Optional contextual link referencing official documentation",
            "url": "url"
          }
        ]
      },
      "feature-name-2": {
        "value": "Experimental",
        "flag": "neutral",
        "supported": true
      },
      "feature-name-3": {
        "value": "NO",
        "flag": "negative",
        "supported": false
      }
    }
}
```

| category-name.feature-name-1.links.title | string | yes | The title of the link |

On each pull request, the JSON files are verified to be sure they are valid and well-formatted. You can run the following command inside the `scripts` directory to format the JSON before sending a pull request:

```
node json-format.js
```
